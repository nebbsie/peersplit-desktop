### What Will It Do?
Peersplit allow's users to store/backup files onto a distributed network of devices instead of storing on centralised servers. This increases the security and reliability of the data storage whilst decreasing costs. The application allows users to upload files and download files. It also allows users to setup thier device as a storage holder. If users allow storage on thier devices, they will be rewarded with small payments depending on the amount of storage they give.
